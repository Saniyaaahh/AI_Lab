# Artificial Intelligence Programs Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to the Artificial Intelligence Programs repository! This repository contains a collection of programs implemented in Python, focusing on various artificial intelligence techniques. These programs are developed as part of academic coursework or personal projects to explore different AI algorithms and their applications.

## Content
The repository includes implementations of AI algorithms such as:
- Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks)
- Natural Language Processing algorithms (e.g., Tokenization, Part-of-Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis)
- Computer Vision algorithms (e.g., Image Classification, Object Detection, Facial Recognition)
- Reinforcement Learning algorithms (e.g., Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks, Policy Gradient Methods)

Each algorithm is implemented in Python and accompanied by documentation explaining its functionality, usage, and examples.

## Usage
To utilize the programs in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-programs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired AI algorithm implementation.
3. Execute the Python script using an appropriate Python interpreter:
   ```
   python program_name.py
   ```
